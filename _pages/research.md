### Technology and the Geography of the Foreign Exchange Market (2023) 
[Journal of International Money and Finance, 131-2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0261560623000037) with Barry
Eichengreen (Berkeley), Arnaud Mehl (ECB) and M. Minesso (ECB)

March 2016 NBER digest, Vox Column and press coverage: Les Echos.

*We analyze the impact of technology  on the production and trade in services,
focusing on  the location of foreign  exchange transactions and the  effect of
submarine  fiber-optic  cable  connections. Cable  connections  between  local
markets and  major financial  centers reduce the  costs of  trading currencies
locally and  increase the share of  currency transactions taking place  in the
issuing  country. But  they  also  attenuate the  effect  of existing  spatial
frictions that prevent transactions from  moving offshore to take advantage of
agglomeration  economies  and  thick-market   advantages  of  major  financial
centers. In practice, this second effect dominates. Our estimates suggest that
the  advent of  cable  connections boosted  the share  in  global turnover  of
London, the world’s largest trading venue, by as much as one-third.*


### Macrofinancial Feedback, Bank Stress Testing and Capital Surcharges (2023)
With Tobias Adrian (IMF) and Jose Berrospide (Federal
Reserve Board). Draft available soon. 

*We develop  a framework  to assess  macrofinancial vulnerabilities  across the
business  and financial  cycles, and  to calibrate  a countercyclical  capital
buffer (CCyB)  to account  for those  vulnerabilities in  the context  of bank
stress tests. A  parsimonious model captures the  dynamic relationship between
bank  capital, financial  conditions, and  GDP growth,  quantifies the  causal
impact  of shocks  to bank  capital on  the future  distribution of  financial
conditions  and   future  downside   risks  to   GDP  growth,   and  estimates
macrofinancial  feedback  effects.   Our   model  calibrates  a  bank  capital
surcharge, the  additional bank capital  that accounts for  the macrofinancial
feedback---typically overlooked  in bank  stress tests---as  a macroprudential
tool  to  avert banks'  amplification  of  shocks  to  the economy.   Using  a
Growth-at-Risk  based metric  as a  measure of  financial stability  risks, we
calibrate the size and the timing of the CCyB, as the capital needed to offset
the macrofinancial feedback across the business cycle.*

### Foreign Exchange Interventions Rules for Central Banks: A Risk-Based Framework (2021) 
[IMF Working Paper
No. 21/32](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2021/02/12/Foreign-Exchange-Intervention-Rules-for-Central-Banks-A-Risk-based-Framework-50081)
with Romain Veyrune (IMF). 

*This paper presents a rule for foreign exchange interventions (FXI), designed
to preserve  financial stability in  floating exchange rate  arrangements. The
FXI rule addresses a market failure:  the absence of hedging solution for tail
exchange rate risk in the market  (i.e. high volatility). Market impairment or
overshoot  of  exchange  rate  between  two  equilibria  could  generate  high
volatility  and  threaten financial  stability  due  to unhedged  exposure  to
exchange rate risk in the economy. The  rule uses the concept of Value at Risk
(VaR) to define FXI triggers. While it  provides to the market a hedge against
tail  risk, the  rule  allows the  exchange  rate to  smoothly  adjust to  new
equilibria. In  addition, the  rule is  budget neutral  over the  medium term,
encourages a prudent  risk management in the market, and  is more resilient to
speculative  attacks than  other rules,  such as  fixed-volatility rules.  The
empirical methodology is  backtested on Banco Mexico’s FXIs  data between 2008
and 2016.*

### Predictive Density Aggregation: A Model for Global GDP Growth (2020) 
[IMF Working Paper No. 20/78](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2020/05/29/Predictive-Density-Aggregation-A-Model-for-Global-GDP-Growth-49441)
with Francesca Caselli, Francesco Grigoli and Changchun Wang (all IMF). 

*We propose  a novel approach to  obtain the predictive density  of global GDP
growth.  It hinges  upon a  bottom-up probabilistic  model that  estimates and
combines  single  countries’  predictive  GDP growth  densities,  taking  into
account    cross-country    interdependencies.    Specifically,    we    model
non-parametrically  the contemporaneous  interdependencies  across the  United
States, the euro  area, and China via a conditional  kernel density estimation
of a  joint distribution.  Then,  we characterize the  potential amplification
effects stemming  from other large  economies in each region—also  with kernel
density estimations—and the  reaction of all other  economies with para-metric
assumptions. Importantly, each economy's predictive  density also depends on a
set  of observable  country-specific factors.   Finally, the  use of  sampling
techniques allows us to aggregate individual countries’ densities into a world
aggregate while  preserving the  non-i.i.d.  nature of  the global  GDP growth
distribution. Out-of-sample metrics confirm the accuracy of our approach.*

### Growth-at-Risk: Concept and Application in IMF Country Surveillance (2019)
[IMF Working Paper No. 19/36](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2019/02/21/Growth-at-Risk-Concept-and-Application-in-IMF-Country-Surveillance-46567)
with Changchun Wang and others (all IMF).

*The Growth-at-Risk (GaR) framework links current macrofinancial conditions to
the distribution of future growth. Its  main strength is its ability to assess
the entire distribution of future GDP growth (in contrast to point forecasts),
quantify macrofinancial risks in terms of growth, and monitor the evolution of
risks to economic activity over time.  By using GaR analysis, policymakers can
quantify the  likelihood of risk scenarios,  which would serve as  a basis for
preemptive action. This paper offers practical  guidance on how to conduct GaR
analysis and  draws lessons from  country case  studies. It also  discusses an
Excel-based GaR  tool developed  to support  the IMF's  bilateral surveillance
efforts.*


### Fast Trading and the Virtue of Entropy: Evidence from the Foreign Exchange Market (2018)
[ECB Working Paper
No. 2300](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2300~68bda93b78.en.pdf)
With Giancarlo Corsetti (Cambridge) and Arnaud Mehl (ECB).

*Focusing on the  foreign exchange reaction to  macroeconomic announcements, we
show that  fast trading  is positively and  significantly correlated  with the
entropy of  the distribution of  quoted prices in  reaction to news:  a larger
share of fast trading increases the degree of diversity of quotes in the order
book,   for  given   liquidity,   order   book  depth   and   size  of   order
flows. Exploiting the WM Reuters’ reform of the fixing methodology in February
2015 as  a natural experiment,  we provide  evidence that fast  trading raises
entropy, rather than reacting to it. While more entropy in quoted prices means
noisier  information   and  arguably  complicates  price   discovery  from  an
individual trader’s perspective, we show  that, in the aggregate, more entropy
actually  brings traded  prices  closer  to the  random  walk hypothesis,  and
improves indicators  of market efficiency  and quality of trade  execution. We
estimate that a 10 percent increase  in entropy reduces the negative impact of
macro news  by over 60% for  effective spreads, against over  40% for realized
spreads and  price impacts. Our  findings suggest that  high-frequency quoting
may have desirable  effects on market performance,  specifically stemming from
enhanced heterogeneity in trading patterns.*

### Can Countries Manage Their Financial Conditions Amid Globalization? (2018) 
[IMF Working Paper No. 18/15](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2018/01/24/Can-Countries-Manage-Their-Financial-Conditions-Amid-Globalization-45581)
with Nicolas Arregui, Selim Elekdag, Gaston Gelos and Dulani Seneviratne (all IMF).

*This  paper  examines the  evolving  importance  of common  global  components
underlying  domestic financial  conditions. It  develops financial  conditions
indices (FCIs) that  make it possible to  compare a large set  of advanced and
emerging market economies. It finds that a common component, “global financial
conditions,” accounts for  about 20 percent to 40 percent  of the variation in
countries’  domestic FCIs,  with notable  heterogeneity across  countries. Its
importance, however,  does not seem to  have increased markedly over  the past
two decades.   Global financial conditions  loom large, but  evidence suggests
that, on average, countries still appear  to hold considerable sway over their
own financial conditions—specifically,  through monetary policy. Nevertheless,
the rapid speed  at which foreign shocks affect  domestic financial conditions
may also  make it  difficult to  react in  a timely  and effective  manner, if
deemed necessary.*


### Thick vs. Thin-Skinned:  Technology, News, and Financial Market Reaction (2017) 
[IMF working paper No. 17/91](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2017/04/07/Thick-vs-44810)
with Barry Eichengreen (Berkeley) and Arnaud Mehl (ECB)

*We study  the impact of  technology on the  reaction of financial  markets to
information,  focusing  on  the  foreign exchange  market.   We  contrast  the
“thin-skinned”  view that  technological improvements  cause markets  to react
more to new information with the “thick-skinned” view that they react less. We
pinpoint exogenous technological changes using the timing of the connection of
countries via  the submarine fiber-optic  cables used for  electronic trading.
Cable connections dampen the response of exchange rates to macroeconomic news,
consistent with the “thick-skinned” hypothesis. This  is in line with the view
that  technology  eases  access  to information  and  reduces  trend-following
behavior. According to our estimates, cable connections reduce the reaction of
exchange rates to U.S.  monetary policy news by 50 to 80 percent.*


### Understanding Household Savings in China: the Role of the Housing Market & Borrowing Constraints (2013) 
[MPRA Paper No. 44611](https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/44611.html) with Matthieu Bussière (Banque de France), Yannick Kalantzis (Banque de
France) and Terry Sicular (Western Ontario) 

*This  paper  examines  the  role   of  rising  housing  prices  and  borrowing
constraints as determinants of China's  high household saving rate, especially
among young  households. Using a  life-cycle model  of saving behavior  in the
presence  of borrowing  constraints,  we show  that  the relationship  between
housing prices and saving exists only under certain conditions and for certain
groups of households.  Specifically, when the return  on financial instruments
is low (which is  the case in China), the saving rate  of young households may
increase with housing prices. This  relationship, moreover, is non- linear and
depends on the  level of wealth. Employing an empirical  strategy motivated by
the theoretical model, we analyze a dataset of over six thousand Chinese urban
households  spanning the  years 1995,  2002 and  2007. We  find evidence  that
higher  housing  prices  do  in  fact  increase  the  saving  rates  of  young
households. We also find evidence for the predicted non-linearity.*
