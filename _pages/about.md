Welcome to the website of Romain Lafarguette (罗哲文), Ph.D., quantitative researcher (_quant_) at the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), the sovereign wealth fund of Abu Dhabi.

I work in ADIA's "Q" team, where we develop systematic trading strategies, leveraging data science, statistics and machine learning. 

I am specialized in:
- Monetary and financial economics
- Central banking operations
- Stress-testing

I combine technical skills in modeling, programming, and finance with a 10-year international policy experience with the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank. I have done missions to more than 25 countries, covering monetary and financial issues, on technical assistance, IMF financing programs, and surveillance. I also led teams of 3 to 7 people on technical assistance missions to central banks. 
 
I am very active on [Github](https://github.com/romainlafarguette). You can
also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/romain-lafarguette-罗哲
