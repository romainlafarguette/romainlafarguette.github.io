Welcome to the website of Romain Lafarguette (罗哲文), Ph.D., macro-quant (buy-side) at the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), the sovereign wealth fund of Abu Dhabi.

I am part of ADIA's "Q" team, where we develop systematic trading strategies, leveraging big data, statistics, and machine learning. I work both on alpha generation via systematic trading and multi-assets allocation/total portfolio management for ADIA. 

I am specialized in:
- Macro quantitative modeling
- Density modeling and forecasting
- Central banking and monetary policy

I am a former IMF technical assistance mission chief and ECB market operations expert. I combine technical skills in modeling, programming, and finance with a 10-year international policy experience on a wide-range of countries and issues.

I have done missions to more than 25 countries, covering monetary and financial issues, on technical assistance, IMF financing programs, and surveillance. I also led teams of 3 to 7 people on technical assistance missions to central banks. 

I hold a Ph.D. in economics from Peking University and Paris School of Economics, a master in applied mathematics and statistics from ENSAE ParisTech. I am a normalien, former student of the Ecole Normale Superieure Paris-Saclay. I speak fluently English and Chinese Mandarin. I am a native French-speaker. 

I am very active on [Github](https://github.com/romainlafarguette). You can
also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/romain-lafarguette-罗哲
