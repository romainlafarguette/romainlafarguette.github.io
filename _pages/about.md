Welcome to the website of Romain Lafarguette (罗哲文), lead quant strategist, senior vice-president
at GIC (Government of Singapore Investment Corporation), the sovereign wealth fund of Singapore.

I manage a team of 6 quants in asset allocation and global macro modeling for GIC Fixed Income and MultiAssets (FIMA) department. We supports GIC portfolio managers in optimizing and allocating multi-billions portfolios; we also carry macro signals research for systematic and discretionary trading. 

As a quant, I design and implement quantitative macroeconomic signals (forecasting, nowcasting, regimes modeling, etc.) and leverage density modeling and optimization methods for asset allocation. I use  alternative and standard  data, statistics (frequentist  and Bayesian), and machine learning, mostly in the time series space. I also handle backtesting, package deployment and some quant production-related issues. 

I  combine technical  skills  in  financial modeling, programming,  and  quantitative macroeconomics with more than 10-year operational experience with  [ADIA](https://www.adia.ae/) - the sovereign wealth fund of Abu Dhabi, the  [International
Monetary Fund](https://www.imf.org/en/Home) in Washington D.C. and the [European Central Bank](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html) in Frankfurt.

While at the IMF, I  have  done missions  to  more  than  25  countries, covering  monetary  and
financial  issues,  on  technical  assistance,  IMF  financing  programs,  and
surveillance.   I also  led teams  of 3  to 7  people on  technical assistance
missions to central banks.

I also taught quantitative financial methods, quantitative macroeconomics and inferential statistics to government officials and IMF staff. 

I hold a Ph.D.  in financial economics from Peking University and the Paris School
of Economics, and a master degree in applied mathematics and statistics from ENSAE
ParisTech.

I  am a "normalien", former  student of the Ecole  Normale Superieure
Paris-Saclay.  I  speak fluently English and  Chinese Mandarin. I am  a native
French-speaker.

I used to be active on [Github](https://github.com/romainlafarguette), but my current role does not allow me to publish new packages.  You can
also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/romain-lafarguette-罗哲
