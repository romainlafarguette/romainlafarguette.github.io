Welcome to the  website of Romain Lafarguette (罗哲文),  Ph.D., buy-side quant
at the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), the sovereign wealth fund of Abu
Dhabi.

I am part of ADIA's quant team  ("Q").  I work on assets allocation (strategic
and tactical horizons), portfolio construction  as well as on alpha generation
for systematic trading.

I use  alternative and standard  data, statistics (frequentist  and Bayesian),
and machine learning, mostly in the time series space.  I develop Python tools
for macro-financial signals generation and portfolio construction.

I  combine technical  skills  in  modeling, programming,  and  finance with  a
10-year  international  macro-financial   experience  with  the  International
Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank.

I  have  done missions  to  more  than  25  countries, covering  monetary  and
financial  issues,  on  technical  assistance,  IMF  financing  programs,  and
surveillance.   I also  led teams  of 3  to 7  people on  technical assistance
missions to central banks.

I hold a Ph.D.  in financial economics from Peking University and Paris School
of Economics, a master degree in applied mathematics and statistics from ENSAE
ParisTech.

I  am a normalien, former  student of the Ecole  Normale Superieure
Paris-Saclay.  I  speak fluently English and  Chinese Mandarin. I am  a native
French-speaker.

I am  very active  on [Github](https://github.com/romainlafarguette).  You can
also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/romain-lafarguette-罗哲
