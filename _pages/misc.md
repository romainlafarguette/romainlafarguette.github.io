## Resources

### Python
* I  can not  recommend enough  using Python  for econometrics/statistics/data
manipulation and data visualization. I have been a huge R fan for many years -
and I still like it - but I prefer Python for most of my daily tasks.

* A very easy way to use Python for scientific applications is to download the
Anaconda  distribution  (admin  rights  are  not  necessary).  Anaconda  is  a
completely  free  Python  distribution   (including  for  commercial  use  and
redistribution). It includes more than 400 of the most popular Python packages
for      science,     math,      engineering,      and     data      analysis:

*  Please  find  some  helpful  resources  below.  I  strongly  recommend  the
  Introduction  to  Python  for  Econometrics, Statistics  and  Data  Analysis
  written by Kevin Sheppard, from the University of Oxford. 

    * Introduction to Python for Econometrics, Statistics and Data Analysis, by Kevin
    Sheppard, University of Oxford: [link](https://www.kevinsheppard.com/images/0/09/Python_introduction.pdf)

    * You can find on my Github repo a list of Python tricks that I have gathered
    across time [link](https://github.com/romainlafarguette/tips/blob/master/python_tricks.org)

    * Quantitative Economics (Thomas Sargent and John Stachurski) uses Python and
    Julia to develop some economics applications: link. They have very nice
    jupyter notebooks as well ! ([link](http://quantecon.org/notebooks.html))

    * The Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences has comprehensive
    slides, videos and tutorials on how to use Python: [link](http://cs109.github.io/2014/index.html)

    * A beginner-oriented website to learn how to use Python in a professional
    environment: Automate the Boring Stuff with Python: [link](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)

    * Python for Economists, by Alex Bell, Brown University: [link](http://cs.brown.edu/~ambell/pyseminar/Python_for_Economists.pdf)

    * Numpy and Scipy are among the most useful packages for scientific applications
      with Python. A gentle introduction is provided by John Stachurski [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/QuantEcon/QuantEcon.notebooks/blob/master/sci_python_quickstart.ipynb)

    * Pandas is probably the most important Python package for manipulating datasets
    and vizualise  them: link  I like  using HDF5 for  storing large  datasets and
    manipulate them  easily. It  is much  faster than SQL  for numerical  data and
    integrates seamlessly with Pandas: [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format)


### Emacs

* Windows and Mac users can install the modified Emacs version by Vincent
  Goulet, which incorporates most of the packages useful for econometrics (ESS :
  R/Stata, etc.) and LateX (AucteX): [link](http://vgoulet.act.ulaval.ca/en/emacs/) 

* My dot emacs file (.emacs) is available
  [here](https://github.com/romainlafarguette/tips/blob/master/dotemacs). 

* You need to install wmctrl, aspell, flyspell, browse-killring, isend-mode and
  framemove using  the Alt +  X package-install  command. Note that  my dotemacs
  focuses on the programs I use the  most, e.g. orgmode, Python, LateX and R. In
  particular,  I emulate  the matlab  cell behaviour  for Python  using the  #%%
  delimiter. I  also emulate the  darkroom mode  (no distraction mode),  see the
  file for more details
